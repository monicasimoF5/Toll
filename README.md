# Toll and vehicles

**Requirements:**
Develop a program that models a toll collection system. Toll booths should have a name, city, and a numeric attribute representing the total toll revenue collected.

Vehicles arriving at a toll booth should have a license plate number. The toll amount varies based on the vehicle type. Cars are charged $100, motorcycles $50, and trucks are charged $50 per axle.

The toll booth should calculate the toll amount for each vehicle and maintain a running total of the collected revenue. The system should output a list of vehicles that have passed through the toll booth and the total revenue collected.
